# Anthropic Bedrock provider

`AnthropicBedrockProvider` sends Anthropic Messages API requests directly to Amazon Bedrock
through `@anthropic-ai/bedrock-sdk`. It supports the Anthropic-compatible Mantle endpoint and
Bedrock Runtime, preferring Mantle when the selected model is available in-region. Its caller
supplies the complete system instructions and tool definitions; the provider does not launch
Claude Code or adopt its tool execution and permission runtime.

## Request contract

The provider follows Claude Code's foreground inference shape:

- 64,000 maximum output tokens;
- adaptive thinking, with the requested effort in `output_config`;
- the one-million-context and interleaved-thinking betas;
- ephemeral prompt-cache breakpoints on the system prompt and latest message;
- the caller's complete rebuilt transcript, including signed thinking, tool calls, tool results,
  and images.

On Mantle, the SDK sends the normal Anthropic request to `/v1/messages`, retains the direct model
ID, and puts betas in the `anthropic-beta` header. On Runtime, it adds
`anthropic_version: "bedrock-2023-05-31"`, moves betas to `anthropic_beta`, removes `model` and
`stream` from the body, and calls
`/model/<regional-inference-profile>/invoke-with-response-stream`. Logical Rig model IDs are
resolved to direct Mantle IDs or the appropriate Runtime regional inference profile. Logical IDs
outside the curated catalog are rejected locally; callers can pass a Bedrock model or
inference-profile ID directly when intentionally using an unlisted model.

Rig's Bedrock executor owns an ordered model/transport/region table. The first matching transport
wins:

| Model           | Preferred Mantle regions                                                  | Runtime fallback           |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| Claude Sonnet 5 | `eu-north-1`, `eu-west-1`, `us-east-1`                                    | Commercial Bedrock regions |
| Claude Fable 5  | `us-east-1`                                                               | Commercial Bedrock regions |
| Claude Opus 4.8 | `ap-northeast-1`, `eu-north-1`, `eu-west-1`, `us-east-1`, `us-gov-west-1` | Commercial Bedrock regions |

These Mantle lists are the intersection of the AWS Mantle endpoint regions and each model's
documented in-region availability. Runtime remains the fallback because it supports geographic
and global inference profiles. A per-model `transport = "mantle"` or `transport = "runtime"`
override can force one supported surface; pairing it with `endpoint` supports a custom gateway.

## Runtime ownership

Rig remains responsible for persistence, local tool execution, permissions, and the outer agent
loop. Only local tools are accepted. The provider maps Anthropic text, thinking, signed reasoning,
tool-use JSON, cache usage, and stop reasons into normal `SessionEvent` values.
It also emits opaque ordered response items so interleaved thinking, text, and tool-use blocks can
be persisted and replayed without reordering.

The SDK's hidden retries are disabled. The provider performs Claude-compatible retryable
connection, 408, 409, 429, and 5xx retries itself, emits `retrying` events, and never retries after
stream content has begun.

`compact()` uses Bedrock's native server-side compaction when the selected context is at or above
the 50,000-token minimum, with the `compact-2026-01-12` beta and `compact_20260112`
context-management edit. It pauses at the native compaction boundary, aggregates per-iteration
usage, and retains the opaque replay metadata. Below the minimum, or when a native request returns
no compaction block, it falls back to one tool-less summary request. Usage from both requests is
retained when a native attempt falls back. In all cases the result contains the complete
replacement context.

## Credentials

Load `BedrockBearerTokenCredential`, normally from `AWS_BEARER_TOKEN_BEDROCK`. The provider accepts
an explicit region and otherwise defaults to `us-east-1`; environment resolution belongs to the
executor/configuration layer.

## Verification

`tests/anthropicBedrockProvider.test.ts` exercises regional routing, signed-thinking replay,
provider-owned retry, native compaction, Mantle and Runtime wire shapes, exact current Rig prompt
and tools, and the captured Claude golden response stream.
`tests/anthropicBedrock.live.test.ts` performs a real preferred-endpoint turn when
`RIG_LIVE_TEST=1` and a bearer token are available.
